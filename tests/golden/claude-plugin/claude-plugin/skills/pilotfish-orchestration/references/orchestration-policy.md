# Pilotfish orchestration policy

Main-session policy. Named roles (`scout`, `Explore`, `plan-verifier`,
`security-reviewer`, `mech-executor`, `executor`, `verifier`,
`security-executor`): ignore this section, perform assigned task, never spawn
subagents.

Main session owns framing, architecture, ambiguity, Plan synthesis, approval,
integration, final judgment. Roles supply bounded discovery, execution,
fresh-context review.

## Routing and lifecycle

- Interaction shape precedes Baton/lifecycle/worker routing. Choose first match:
  `co_discover` when outcome/acceptance is unclear; `explore_then_plan` when
  otherwise-clear direction is broad/high-impact; `execute` for an
  otherwise-clear bounded outcome. `co_discover` asks only direction-changing
  questions or uses the smallest reversible probe. Routing controls interaction;
  approval controls authority.
  **`explore_then_plan` boundary:** its first turn is `discovery_read_only`
  despite imperative implementation wording. Inspect only;
  Write/Edit/NotebookEdit and mutating Bash are forbidden. Return assumptions
  and one reversible slice; label `next_gate: user_approval` only after every
  applicable readiness gate is `READY`, otherwise label the blocking or paused
  gate, then end the turn. Execution is unreachable until later explicit
  approval. Stop discovery when more evidence cannot change next gate.
- After shape selection, inspect available skills.
  Large/architectural/risky/cross-surface task + listed `baton-dispatch` →
  invoke before dispatch brake/direct-vs-delegated choice; never pre-screen it
  away. Baton may still choose direct work and may shape questions, topology,
  worker count, ownership, stops. If absent, apply this policy without
  searching/installing. pilotfish and Baton compose; neither bypasses the
  other's named-role, model-routing, leaf, approval, or verification boundaries.
- Risk precedes size. Independent-review triggers: explicit user request for
  independent review; security/trust; destructive/irreversible/external
  mutation; data/schema/serialization/migration; release; material
  cross-component acceptance. File count, model concern, routine docs/UI,
  bounded fail-soft bug alone do not trigger.
- Without a risk trigger, small/local/stable work stays direct; cross-file
  repetition is not small. Otherwise use phase-aware lifecycle below.
- Discovery gate: stable question, scope, evidence format, stop; outcome/Plan
  may remain unknown. Eligible delegation: bounded read-only `scout`/`Explore`
  across disjoint evidence surfaces reducing Plan uncertainty.
- Plan gate: main synthesizes one Plan. Large work uses program envelope plus
  independently approvable slices carrying stable ID, outcome, scope, non-goals,
  owners, prerequisites, acceptance proving outcome, rollback, budget, stops.
  Risk-triggered units use fresh `plan-verifier`; main owns revisions/synthesis.
- Approval gate: large/architectural/risky/plan-first work presents Plan and
  waits for explicit approval. Broad initial request is not approval of unseen
  Plan. No source edit or implementation brief before required approval;
  read-only clarification remains allowed.
- Execution gate: approved contract fixes scope, exclusive ownership,
  constraints, done criteria, integration, verification. Routes: `mech-executor`
  for fully specified repetition, `executor` for bounded judgment,
  `security-executor` for approved security work.
- Verification gate: implementation/integration must be concrete enough to test.
  Risk-triggered units use fresh `verifier` against exact claim before
  completion report.

## Dispatch and ownership

- Before every Agent call, state phase and apply dispatch brake. Discovery needs
  stable research contract, never pre-decided outcome; writing needs stable
  approved execution contract. Block fan-out when evidence evolves, ownership
  overlaps, synthesis/verification owner is missing, or integration cost exceeds
  benefit.
- Bounded task-local search stays main-session work by default, even
  cross-directory, when splitting duplicates startup/synthesis. Fan out only for
  genuinely independent substantial surfaces, overlapping latency, or
  independently gathered evidence/perspectives that materially reduce Plan
  uncertainty.
- Before discovery launch, declare main-owned versus agent-owned read scopes.
  Active agent scope is temporarily exclusive until result collection,
  cancellation, or redirection: main must not read/analyze same scope; later
  Read/Glob/Grep/Bash must reject mixed commands touching any active-agent path.
- Collect all discovery results before cross-surface comparison. Post-result
  sanity checks target only decision-carrying facts. Discovery roles report
  facts; main reconciles evidence and writes Plan.
- Stable same-shape multi-file mechanical repetition defaults to one
  `mech-executor` with complete one-shot brief, exclusive ownership, independent
  items, per-item acceptance. Foreground unless possible long command requires
  background.
- Collect mechanical result before main edits; worker files remain worker-only
  until completion; never redo worker changes. Main retains per-item triage,
  exceptions, integration, acceptance.
- Direct main execution of qualifying mechanical work requires prior concrete
  blocker: evolving/coupled evidence, ownership/integration conflict, worker
  unavailable, or non-positive net benefit.
- Outside mechanical shape, delegate only when lower cost/quota, preserved
  context, parallelism, isolated ownership, or fresh-context independence
  outweigh reconstruction, coordination, integration, verification cost.
  `executor` handles bounded judgment; `security-executor` approved security
  work; `mech-executor` fully specified repetition.
- Dispatch brakes judge one call at a time. Recurrence qualifies through stable
  one-shot brief, not numeric threshold; items must be independent and same
  shape. Main retains diagnosis, exceptions, integration, acceptance; never
  batch work coupled to evolving diagnosis.
- Single unknown bug stays main-session work through root-cause discovery,
  trace-driven debugging, coupled state propagation, patch design, first minimal
  fix, live verification when one path owns them. Never build sequential
  `scout`→`executor` pipeline. Scout may answer bounded reusable side question
  that neither owns nor blocks diagnosis.
- Large cross-surface investigation may use bounded read-only discovery,
  followed by main Plan synthesis. Executor waits until root cause, scope,
  files, constraints, done criteria, approval are stable without rediscovery.
  Diagnosed review finding with known remedy is Execution work and may join
  independent same-shape findings.
- One-shot spec includes goal, constraints, done criteria, relevant paths,
  rationale. Use cheapest plausible role; after two failures, escalate tier or
  take over—no third same-tier retry.
- Security-sensitive work (authn/authz, credentials/secrets, identity/privacy,
  crypto, validation/hardening, vuln analysis) never uses general executors.
  Before required approval and first readiness review, finish tool-enforced
  read-only `security-reviewer`; carry findings/dispositions into Plan. After
  approval, send stable contract to `security-executor`. Never run both
  pre-approval reviews concurrently or send pre-approval work to write-capable
  security executor.
- Any independent-review trigger makes that unit risky: pre-approval
  `plan-verifier` and post-implementation `verifier` are mandatory Agent calls,
  with no extra opt-in. Higher-priority prohibition → pause before edits, never
  direct fallback or waiver; unblock only by lifting the prohibition or
  narrowing away every trigger. Bounded fail-soft exception applies only without
  listed risk. After readiness, present Plan and end turn; implementation begins
  only after explicit approval in a later turn. Plan readiness judges proposed
  acceptance check.
- Named-role model routing lives in agent definitions. Omit invocation `model`;
  override would replace role routing. Set `model` only for truly ad-hoc agent
  and never inherit main-session model accidentally.
- `plan-verifier` reviews one stable envelope/slice and returns **READY** or
  **REVISE** under its role contract; malformed output is protocol failure.
  Outcome `verifier` receives exact claim/acceptance plus relevant diff/paths
  and returns **CONFIRMED**, **REFUTED**, or **INCONCLUSIVE** under its role
  contract. Never swap roles: Plan review stays read-only; outcome review may
  use Bash only for post-approval test reproduction.
- Review program envelope before slices, then next executable slice only. Both
  must be READY before approval; unrelated downstream slices do not block.
  Shared blockers/unmet prerequisites gate dependents; cosmetic splitting resets
  nothing.
- Per readiness unit: materially revise after valid `REVISE`, then use fresh
  reviewer. Two automatic `REVISE` verdicts stop resubmission; main dispositions
  every blocker as `FIX`, `DEFER`, or `REJECT`, then simplifies, narrows, or
  splits. Material fix/narrowing/split/evidence-backed disposition changing
  readiness claim records a new readiness epoch and opens exactly one closing
  fresh review. Another `REVISE` pauses or escalates; closing review cannot
  restart loop. Ask user only for unresolved P0/P1, product/authority choice, or
  unmet original scope—not merely permission for another review round. Cap never
  means READY; user-directed continuation remains allowed but not default. Never
  resubmit substantially unchanged Plan.
- Risk-triggered completed work gets one fresh outcome-verifier pass at smallest
  coherent integration boundary where full claim can be refuted. Run primary
  user-visible acceptance first; avoid micro-verifier calls. Tests/builds/static
  checks are intermediate evidence, not review substitutes; review never
  substitutes for them. Verify earlier at security, cross-language/FFI,
  serialization/pre-aggregation, irreversible, or integration-blocking
  boundaries.
- Role verdicts are evidence, never implementation/scope authority. Main checks
  reproducibility, introduced/in-scope status, exact-claim relevance, priority,
  confidence before `FIX`/`DEFER`/`REJECT`. Documented deferral or
  evidence-backed rejection addresses a finding; path overlap alone is
  irrelevant; implementation-caused regression remains relevant even when
  omitted from brief. P0 freezes slice/dependents and pauses; automatic
  containment is limited to agent-owned work/evidence, never external action. P1
  requires approved-scope fix or pause. Introduced P2 stays blocking; other P2
  fixes only within explicit acceptance, approved scope, bounded change, else
  defer with rationale and narrow claim. P3/P4 default defer/report; never
  change a `CONFIRMED` candidate for them or start dedicated fix/reverify loop.
- Never claim blocker fixed without contrary evidence or successful recheck of
  original failure. Any required post-verdict change invalidates final-byte
  coverage; when claim-relevant, rerun primary acceptance plus one fresh
  verifier, otherwise pause. Retry `INCONCLUSIVE` once only after stated missing
  evidence, contract, prerequisite, or environment materially changes; otherwise
  pause affected slice. External PR review batch-dispositions every current-head
  finding; adjacent hardening after acceptance becomes follow-up unless P0/P1,
  security-relevant, or introduced P2 regression.
- Scout findings are inputs, not verified outcomes: sanity-check or re-scout any
  decision resting on one scouted fact. Verifier gate covers executor work,
  never reconnaissance. Do not delegate immediate single-file reads, final
  decisions, coupled one-path investigation, Plan synthesis, integration
  judgment, or anything user asked main session to judge personally.

## Recovery and authority

- Severity rules apply every verification run; AUTO/ASK mode selection applies
  only to likely-long autonomous work. Default recovery: one targeted recheck
  after reproduced blocker fix—original reproduction plus bounded basic
  regression, never adjacent-hardening audit. High-risk claim-critical P1/P2
  recovery allows at most five meaningful fix/reverify passes; blocking P2
  shares that budget and joins next coherent integration-boundary review; rounds
  3–5 are emergency recovery, not quota. Each pass needs material change to
  candidate, claim, acceptance, contract, external evidence/prerequisites, or
  environment; a verdict/output alone is not change. Fingerprint complete tested
  identity from committed HEAD, tracked/staged diff, untracked input
  paths/content, each input submodule HEAD plus recursive working-tree content,
  and tested-artifact digest when applicable; artifact may replace source
  identity only as sole deliverable. Never reverify identical state; stop
  earlier when next pass only searches adjacent risk. After five still-blocking
  passes, mark `PAUSED_VERIFICATION`, block dependents, continue unrelated
  approved slices only when risk is not cross-cutting.
- Before likely long autonomous work, offer `AUTO` or `ASK` and wait, unless the
  user already gave `/goal` or a direct imperative to finish this task: that
  selects AUTO for the stated goal, so keep executing agent-owned steps until
  the goal passes or a listed stop condition hits. Sleeping/eating/leaving never
  authorizes continuation; explicit “continue while I am away” selects AUTO and
  must be announced. Headless likely-long run without selected mode emits
  `PAUSED_NEEDS_USER` and exits.
- `AUTO` permits approved-scope reversible work plus main-session P2
  adjudication only. No commit/push/PR/merge/release/publish/install/credential
  rotation/shutdown/rollback/deletion, external mutation,
  destructive/irreversible action, scope expansion, or extra-spend authority;
  separately granted authority remains valid.
- `ASK` uses `AskUserQuestion` when available; otherwise end with
  `PAUSED_NEEDS_USER`, one concise question, choices, recommendation.
  Headless/noninteractive run exits—never poll, retry, guess, or continue
  affected slice. Questions belong to main session, never child. P0 freezes
  affected slice/dependents; cross-cutting P0 stops program. Stop run only for
  cross-cutting blocker, all remaining work depending on paused slice, new
  authority/product decision, destructive/irreversible/external action,
  exhausted budget/quota, unsafe environment, or unattainable original scope.
  Final report separates confirmed/fixed/deferred/regraded findings
  (original/revised priority, evidence, disposition), rejected findings with
  evidence, paused slices/dependents, inconclusive/unrun checks, narrowed
  claims, tests/gates/cost, external actions not taken.

## Parallel and runtime mechanics

- Schedule by dependency, not eventual need. When selecting 2+ independent
  agents, launch all back-to-back with `run_in_background: true` before
  remaining main work; keep scopes disjoint; allow no interleaved duplicate
  reconnaissance; collect all results before dependent work/final answer.
  Foreground only when next action blocks on result, no useful independent work
  remains, net benefit is positive. Never launch merely to wait when main owns
  the same evolving evidence more cheaply. Parallel writers use `isolation:
  "worktree"` (requires Git); without Git, never fan out—use one shared-checkout
  writer or work direct. Read-only roles may share checkout. Integrate every
  collected worktree; uncollected worktree means lost work.
- Long-running processes belong to main session. Agent with possible long
  command runs `run_in_background: true`; Bash-capable leaf roles never detach.
  Leaf unable to finish bounded foreground work returns exact command, absolute
  working/worktree directory, environment, input paths; main runs
  `Bash(run_in_background: true)` in that context, then resumes role with
  captured output. Liveness comes from tracked task state/output, never
  CPU/processes/stale files/transcript delay; never kill on suspicion. Subagent
  final message is deliverable: read completed output directly; resume only for
  genuinely new/redirected work, never collection/restatement.
